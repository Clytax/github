### What I learned

After the last challenge I participated in, I learned a lot about responsive design! Some people from this great community advised me not to set fixed heights, which I didn't do this time :)

### Continued development

I struggled with using Context, I tried things like "Zustand" which I just couldn't manage to put on the "No Results" screen for some reason. Sometimes it didn't set the error message when I checked if

```javascript
if (!response.ok) {
  setError(true);
}
```

the state has not changed. No idea why.
